                <p class="lead">
                    Since finishing high school in 2017 completing my GCSE's I then proceeded going to my 6thForm college to complete my A-levels. After this time I found myself stuck on what I wanted to do with my life, I worked for my uncle in his industrial property company. I just had a gut feeling that doing this line of work was not pushing myself to the full potential I knew that possessed me. Unfortunately, in early 2021 I found myself in a position where it was needed for immediate brain surgery as I had a block on the brain, this happened in august 2021 and now I am on the road to recovery, which has left me in a great position to peruse my dream. Becoming a developer.

                <p class="lead">
                    After becoming somewhat healed from the surgery, I then went into looking for a new career path, this is where Generation came along, thinking it is too good to be true, I decided to apply anyway, and before you know it finally after all the time and effort I put into it found myself on the Generation TTA course. I have fully grasped the course which has let me access this career path and let me peruse my dreams.                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Please check out my GitHub profile to see my work, along with projects done in the TTA. You can access this by following the link on the footer on my main page. Thank you for taking the time to read this, Troy.                </p>
